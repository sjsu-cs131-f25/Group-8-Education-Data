## Project Description
This project analyzes the relationship between studentsâ€™ performance and their learning styles using a dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to apply big data techniques to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that may help improve learning outcomes.

## Dataset
We are using the **Student Performance and Learning Style** dataset, available here:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-performance-and-learning-style](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-performance-and-learning-style)

The dataset gives information on each student's learning style, academic performance, and study methods.

For instructions on downloading the dataset, please see the [`/data/README.md`](data/README.md).
